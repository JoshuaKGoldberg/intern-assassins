## Issues

We keep track of as much as possible on the issues tracker: issues themselves (bugs, questions, feature requests), issue assignees, milestones.


## Code

Follow the existing style in files you modify.

### Testing

We currently only have `.feature` tests for the APIs.
If you modify an API you must reflect those changes in the feature tests.

### Documentation

Use JSDoc annotations everywhere. Code should otherwise be as self-documenting as possible.

Larger architectural information is kept in the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/intern-assassins/wiki).


## Pull Requests and Commits

Create one pull request per issue when possible.
PRs that address multiple related issues are fine if it would have been difficult to split them.

PR and commit titles should be concise descriptions of the issues.
Bodies should explain in more detail and link to their relevant issue per the [GitHub standard](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

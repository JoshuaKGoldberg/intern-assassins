## Issues

We keep track of as much as possible on the issues tracker: issues themselves (bugs, questions, feature requests), issue assignees, milestones.


## Code

Follow the existing style in files you modify.

### Testing

We currently only have `.feature` tests for the APIs.
If you modify an API you must reflect those changes in the feature tests.

### Documentation

Use JSDoc annotations everywhere. Code should otherwise be as self-documenting as possible.

Larger architectural information is kept in the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/intern-assassins/wiki).


## Pull Requests

Create one pull request per issue when possible.
PRs that address multiple related issues are fine if it would have been difficult to split them.
